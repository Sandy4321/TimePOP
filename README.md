# TimePOP
TimePop is a simple and efficient algorithm that combines the notion of personalized popularity and temporal aspects. 

The main assumption behind a “most popular” approach is that global popularity is a characteristic influencing all the users.
In the approach we introduce here, we change this perspective and we analyze a more fine grained personalized version of  popularity by assuming that it is conditioned by the items that a user u already experienced in the past. To this extent, we look at a specific class of neighbors, that we name Precursors, defined as the users who already rated the same items of u in the past.
